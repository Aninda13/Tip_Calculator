Tipped is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Aninda Halder

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total yet.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* Support for multiple other languages in the app.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* As of yet, just the arbritary box around the Labels caused some issues where the simulator would warp the texts of those labels thus showing incorrect calculation.
